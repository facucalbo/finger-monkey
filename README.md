# finger-monkey

Finger monkey is a highschool project.

You have to hit de letters to score, but be careful because you can drop yourself if you miss letter.

Also you can play multiplayer in LAN, to do this, first run the server project, once is initiated, just run the game in multiplayer mode (just 2 players)
